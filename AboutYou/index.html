        <p>Hi everyone, I am a senior double majoring 
        in Information Technology Infrastructure and Cybersecurity.
        I am hoping to graduate in the summer of 2022 and obtain an internship.
        <br>In my free time, I like to hang out with friends, draw, and be outdoors. 
        I currently have 3 pets and I love to travel.
        </p>
